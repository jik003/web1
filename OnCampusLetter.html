      <br><br>Dear UCSD ITS Field Support Team,
      <p>My name is Jisu Kim and I’m a Junior student majoring in Math-Computer Science. I am writing to express my interest
        in the ITS field assistant position as advertised on Handshake. As a math-cs student, installing programs
        and troubleshooting of a computer and a program are daily work. I believe this position is a perfect fit for me. </p>
        <p>While I was taking a Gap year before I entered College, I used to work as a private math and Korean tutor of high school students.
        I also worked with the supply supporting team in an Academy where students learn the format of essays and the exams for university entrance.
        Those experiences taught me how to be responsible to my students and customers. I believe It can help me thrive
        as a member of the ITS Field Support Assistant (Harford).</p>
      <p>I saw that the desired start date is 1 August 2020. My concern is I will be able to start this job on 1 October 2020
        since I may go back to San Diego around mid September and need to quarantine for 2 weeks following the California Public Health Guideline.
        I desire to work starting on when the quarantine is done, if possible.</p>
      <p>I would love to get an interview for this position. My contact information is below
      <br>jik003@ucsd.edu.</p>
      <p>I am free most of the time and check the email day and night. Since I’m currently in a different time zone,
        I may respond late. Answer will be in 24 hr, however.</p>
      <br>Sincerely, <br><br>
      <strong>Jisu Kim</strong>
